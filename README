This application allows people to buy and sell stuff they need at the lake. Those
without accounts can browse listings by city or category, sorted by
newest/cheapest/most expensive. They can see a quick list view, or thumbnails
or a gallery display, or a detailed view of just one listing.

Those with accounts can do all of the above plus post listings, including a
company logo and contact email address. Photos can be uploaded for listings.
An account allows the user to store their preferred area and their primary
category interest.
