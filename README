API assignment:
===================

The Minnow Bucket Trading Post app now has API endpoints that allow the user to
view categories, subcategories and listings in lists as well as in detail views.
A logged in user can also create new listings and modify their own existing items.

Users can create an account and get an API token by going to
http://localhost:8000/api/register.

The API successfully allows only designated superusers to add categories and
subcategories in the API. The example is user josie, who is now a superuser
and who added the sub-category Floating under Gear. One problem: If the user is
NOT a superuser and tries to access the "add" URL, they receive an error instead
of a redirect.

===================
Earlier assignment:
===================

This application allows people to buy and sell stuff they need at the lake. Those
without accounts can browse listings by city or category, sorted by
newest/cheapest/most expensive. They can see a quick list view, or thumbnails
or a gallery display, or a detailed view of just one listing.

Those with accounts can do all of the above plus post listings, including a
company logo and contact email address. Photos can be uploaded for listings.
An account allows the user to store their preferred area and their primary
category interest.
